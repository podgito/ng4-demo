<p>
  Using the Angular CLI <code>ng build</code> will give you the full transpiled application in the 
  "dist" folder. Your applications code will be bundled and adding the <code>-prod</code> argument 
  will also minify and version the file.
</p>
<p>
  Assets and scripts to be included in the application need to be referenced in the 
  angular-cli.json configuration file so they are emitted with each build.</p>
